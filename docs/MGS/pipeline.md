# Pipeline
## Nextflow
"[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/basic.html) is a reactive workflow framework and a programming domain-specific language (DSL) that eases the writing of data-intensive computational pipelines." It is based on the **Groovy** language. As its [website](https://groovy-lang.org/index.html) describes it:

"Apache Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the **Java** platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional programming."

Nextflow includes additional experimental syntaxes when DSL2 is enabled, which "implements new features and enhancements that simplifies the implementation of data analysis applications".
